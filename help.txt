You are faced up against a terrifying monster, 
and must vanquish it to continue in your quest. 
You have three options: 

Attack: Fight the monster with your regular weapon. 
        It loses a number of hit points equal to your attack power.
 
Bolt  : Powerful fireball to throw at the enemy.
        The enemy loses 7 hit points. 

Heal  : Heal yourself with your magical powers. 
        You gain (up to) 10 hit points. 

Note: you will consume 1 magic point whenever you use a spell
     (bolt / heal). Use them wisely!
